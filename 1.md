## **STEP 5:** Push WebLogic Docker image to OCIR .

- Since we are pushing to a Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry (OCIR), Cloud Shell will use Oracle's Docker registry, OCIR, as the container registry. Log in to Registry. When prompted for a password, enter the auth token that you just generated (Refer to your notes).
```
<copy>docker login -u YOUR_TENANCY_NAMESPACE/YOUR_USERNAME iad.ocir.io</copy> 
```
![](images/1/008.png " ")

- Copy docker pull command in to Cloud Shell to pull WebLogic image.
```
<copy>docker pull store/oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3</copy>
```
![](images/1/009.png " ")

- See your image properly pulled
```  
<copy> docker images </copy>
```
![](images/1/010.png " ")

- Copy Image ID and Tag it according to your **iad.ocir.io/tenancy/weblogic**
```
<copy>docker tag **IMAGE_ID** iad.ocir.io/**TENANCY**/weblogic</copy>
```
![](images/1/011.png " ")

- Push it back to OCIR 
```
<copy> docker push iad.ocir.io/**TENANCY**/weblogic </copy>
```
![](images/1/013.png " ")
